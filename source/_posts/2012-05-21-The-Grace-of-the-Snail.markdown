<i>I want to feel like a stupid, incompetent, worthless person still gets to look at something nice because I have the physical ability to create it.</i>

My wife wrote this about herself -- "I can have something nice, no matter how awful I am, if I can create something nice."

People are foolish and gawky and bad at things and contrary and, and, and...

Sure, okay.

And yet...  It's not how bad your are most of the time.  If at your very best you can make something, then forever after you know you made it.

No matter how slow or ugly the snail, it <i>made</i> that lovely spiraling shell.

You just have to be good enough to make something once.

If I can make one thing and then another, forever after I am a maker.  The grace of the snail is grace indeed, and it's grace enough for me.

What more could I ask?
