Ever notice how most cellular phones don't want to go in my pants?

Uh, I mean, *your* pants.

There may be an external button for the camera, to take many, many pictures of the inside of your pockets, as my old one did.

There may be an external volume button to make your phone silent next time you use it.

There will certainly be poorly controlled buttons that kill your battery by waking your phone up many times.

Without question the phones are designed to be horribly scratched up by your keys, pocket change and other pants paraphernalia.

This is because cellular carriers *do not want you to wear pants*.

Do the only thing you can do:

Call your cellular carrier and tell them:  <span style="font-size: 250%; color:green;">"I am a Pants-Wearing American and you can't tell me not to wear pants!"</span>
