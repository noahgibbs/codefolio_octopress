Hiya!

My name is Noah Gibbs.  I'm the author of <a
href="http://rebuilding-rails.com">Rebuilding Rails</a>, a book about
understanding Ruby web frameworks by building your own, structured
like Rails.

I've spoken at a <a href="http://gogaruco.com">few</a>
<a href="http://www.datastax.com/company/news-and-events/events/cassandrasummit2012/presentations">conferences</a> and a lot of meetups.

I'm a dad.  It's amazing.  <a
href="http://scratch.mit.edu/users/shannasdad/">My little girls and I
write games with Scratch</a>.

I'm a professional Rails-and-Ruby-and-Big-Data-and-stuff developer.

I've written <a href="http://github.com/noahgibbs/">a lot of random
little Ruby libraries<a>.  You can also find some of my open-source
contributions at <a href="http://github.com/ooyala">previous and</a>
<a href="http://github.com/onlive">current employers</a>.

I started coding at eight years old, and I'm a lot older than that
now.  I've never had a real non-programming job.
