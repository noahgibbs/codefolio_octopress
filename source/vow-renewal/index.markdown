Noah and Krissy Gibbs hope you'll join us for a tenth
anniversary and vow renewal on a seven-day Caribbean cruise!

<h2>Travel Arrangements</h2>

To make your travel arrangements (cruise and air travel to Florida), please
call to make your reservations (see below).
Please ask to be linked with reservation #26410014 (Noah and Krissy). You should be on
the Disney Fantasy, embarking August 27th, 2016 from Port Canaveral, Florida. You
should also be in the 1st seating for dinner.

We'll be in stateroom 5546, in case that's useful to know.

A friend recommends her travel agent for cruises, and he can book with Disney. Tom Willyoung at willcruise.com, or (800) 875-3235.

Or you can call Disney directly at (800) 566-0972 if you'd prefer.

<h2>Friends and Family</h2>

If you've been invited, feel free to bring a girl/boyfriend, partner, spouse
or your favorite "it's complicated." This will also be a very child-friendly
gathering. Our family has girls who will be 8 and just-turned-6, and most of
our invitees have children.

As well, we're inviting you to a Disney cruise. There will be many, many child-friendly activities
available for the entire seven days.

<h2>Costs</h2>

Cruises are expensive. Most of the staterooms cost around $1,600 per
person &mdash; though the very nicest ones on this ship go up to
$11,000/person. That's for a suite of rooms larger than our house. So
there's some flexibility. Children are about half of adult price.

It's best to find a travel buddy if you're not already traveling with
someone. Single guests will be charged as two guests, basically.

We are, to be clear, not offering to pay for you. We will understand
entirely if that means you can't afford it. We'd love to see you in
all sorts of cheaper-or-free non-cruise settings as well if that's
preferable.

<h2>Restrictions</h2>

Very pregnant mothers and newborns aren't permitted on the cruise. Make
your early 2016 plans accordingly :-)

<h2>The Ship</h2>

Curious about specifics? A very nice lady on the Internet that I don't
know has <a href="http://www.mission-food.com/2015/06/disney-cruise-line-my-favorite-things.html">written
extensively about the Disney Fantasy</a>, the ship we'll be on.

<h2> Questions? </h2>

We'd love to answer your questions &mdash; especially if they'll help you join us!
Email me and/or Krissy at the.codefolio.guy@gmail.com or somethingdifferent@gmail.com!

Or give us a call - 510-260-5409 for me, or 408-202-4083 for Krissy.

Thanks!
